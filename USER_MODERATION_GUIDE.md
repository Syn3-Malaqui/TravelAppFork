```

## API Integration

### Frontend Functions

#### AdminPanel Component
- `suspendUser(userId, reason)` - Suspend a user with reason
- `unsuspendUser(userId)` - Remove suspension
- `deleteUser(userId)` - Delete user account (with confirmation)

#### ProfilePage Component
- **Automatic detection** of suspended/deleted users
- **Custom UI rendering** based on user status
- **Bilingual support** for suspension messages

## Error Handling

### Common Errors
- **"Only verified admins can suspend users"** - User lacks admin permissions
- **"Cannot suspend admin users"** - Attempted to moderate admin account
- **"User not found"** - Invalid user ID provided
- **"User not found or already deleted"** - User already deleted

### Error Recovery
- **Automatic data refresh** on errors
- **User-friendly error messages** in admin panel
- **Fallback behavior** for profile pages

## Monitoring & Logs

### Moderation Activity
```sql
-- View recent moderation actions
SELECT 
    p.username,
    p.suspended,
    p.suspended_at,
    p.suspended_reason,
    suspended_by_admin.username as suspended_by
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN profiles suspended_by_admin ON p.suspended_by = suspended_by_admin.id
WHERE p.suspended = TRUE 
ORDER BY p.suspended_at DESC;
```

### System Health
```sql
-- Check system statistics
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_users,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE suspended = TRUE) as suspended_users,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL) as deleted_users
FROM profiles;
```

## Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **Always provide clear reasons** for suspensions
2. **Use progressive discipline** - suspend before deleting
3. **Keep records** of moderation decisions
4. **Review suspended accounts** periodically

### For Developers
1. **Test moderation functions** before deployment
2. **Monitor performance** of profile queries
3. **Keep audit logs** for compliance
4. **Regular backup** of user data before bulk moderation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Suspension Not Showing
- Check if user is actually suspended in database
- Verify profile page is checking suspension status
- Ensure admin has proper permissions

#### Delete Confirmation Not Working
- Verify exact text "DELETE" is being entered
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure proper event handling

#### Admin Panel Not Loading Users
- Check database connection
- Verify RLS policies are correct
- Test with smaller user limit

### Support Queries
```sql
-- Check specific user status
SELECT * FROM get_user_moderation_info('USER_ID_HERE');

-- Verify admin permissions
SELECT username, role, verified FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();

-- Test function permissions
SELECT has_function_privilege(auth.uid(), 'suspend_user(uuid,text)', 'execute');
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Temporary suspensions** with automatic unsuspend
- **Moderation reason categories** for better tracking
- **Bulk moderation actions** for efficiency
