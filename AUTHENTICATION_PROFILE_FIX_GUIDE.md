# 🔧 Fix Authentication & Profile Issues - Complete Guide

## Problems Fixed

1. **Authentication Issues**: Users getting "booted out" during login
2. **Profile White Screens**: Blank screens when viewing other people's profiles  
3. **Database Access Issues**: RLS policy conflicts preventing profile access

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Run Database Fixes

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. **Copy and paste** the entire `auth_and_profile_fixes.sql` script
3. **Click Run** to execute all fixes

This will fix:
- ✅ RLS policies preventing profile access
- ✅ Profile creation on signup
- ✅ Foreign key constraints
- ✅ Public access to profiles and tweets

### Step 2: Test the Fixes

1. **Try logging in** - should no longer boot you out
2. **Visit someone's profile** - should load without white screen
3. **Check browser console** for detailed logging:
   - `🔐 Initializing authentication...`
   - `✅ Found existing session`
   - `🔄 Auth state change: SIGNED_IN`

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works

**Test Login:**
```bash
# Open browser console and look for:
✅ User signed in: your@email.com
📝 Creating missing profile...
✅ Profile created successfully
```

**Test Profile Loading:**
```bash
# Visit any profile and check console:
🔍 Fetching users from database...
✅ Fetched users: X
```

## 🔍 Debugging Tools

### Check Your Profile Status
Run this in **Supabase SQL Editor**:
```sql
-- Replace 'your@email.com' with your actual email
SELECT * FROM debug_user_profile('your@email.com');
```

### Check RLS Policies
```sql
SELECT * FROM debug_rls_policies();
```

### Manual Profile Check
```sql
SELECT 
  p.username,
  p.display_name,
  p.role,
  p.verified,
  au.email
FROM profiles p
JOIN auth.users au ON p.id = au.id
WHERE au.email = 'your@email.com';
```

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed

### Authentication (useAuth.ts)
- **Removed aggressive session refresh** that was causing logout loops
- **Added better error handling** with detailed console logging
- **Added automatic profile creation** when signing in
- **Improved session state management** to prevent auth conflicts

### Profile Loading (ProfilePage.tsx)
- **Enhanced error display** instead of white screens
- **Added retry functionality** for failed profile loads  
- **Added detailed error messages** explaining what went wrong
- **Added debug information** for development troubleshooting

### Database (SQL Script)
- **Fixed RLS policies** to allow public profile access
- **Improved profile creation trigger** with error handling
- **Added debugging functions** for troubleshooting
- **Ensured proper foreign key constraints**

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Authentication
1. ✅ **Login works smoothly** without getting booted out
2. ✅ **Session persists** across page refreshes
3. ✅ **Automatic profile creation** for new users
4. ✅ **Clear error messages** if login fails

### Profile Pages
1. ✅ **Profiles load correctly** for all users
2. ✅ **No more white screens** - shows proper error messages instead
3. ✅ **Retry button** if profile loading fails
4. ✅ **Fast loading** with proper caching

### Console Logging
You'll now see detailed logs like:
- `🔐 Initializing authentication...`
- `✅ Found existing session`
- `🔄 Auth state change: SIGNED_IN user@email.com`
- `📝 Creating missing profile...`
- `✅ Profile created successfully`

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Booted Out?
1. **Clear browser storage**: Delete cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage
2. **Check environment variables**: Ensure VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are correct
3. **Run the SQL script again**: Make sure all policies were applied

### Still Seeing White Screens?
1. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Use the retry button** on the error page
3. **Run the debug functions** in Supabase SQL Editor
4. **Check if the user actually exists** in the profiles table

### Database Issues?
1. **Verify RLS is enabled** on profiles table
2. **Check that policies exist** using `debug_rls_policies()`
3. **Ensure trigger is working** for new user creation

## 📋 Quick Test Checklist

- [ ] Can log in without getting booted out
- [ ] Can view your own profile
- [ ] Can view other people's profiles (no white screen)
- [ ] Profile pages show proper error messages if user doesn't exist
- [ ] Console shows detailed authentication logs
- [ ] New users get profiles created automatically

## 🔄 If Issues Persist

1. **Run this diagnostic query** in Supabase:
```sql
-- Check your profile status
SELECT * FROM debug_user_profile('your@email.com');

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM debug_rls_policies();

-- Test profile access
SELECT COUNT(*) as profile_count FROM profiles;
```

2. **Check browser console** for error messages
3. **Try incognito/private browsing** to test with fresh session
4. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly

The authentication and profile loading issues should now be completely resolved!
