## 🔄 Migration Checklist

### Pre-Migration
- [ ] Backup current Netlify deployment settings
- [ ] Note custom domain settings (if any)
- [ ] Document environment variables from Netlify

### During Migration
- [ ] Repository changes pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Vercel project created and connected
- [ ] Environment variables configured in Vercel
- [ ] Supabase redirect URLs updated
- [ ] Build completed successfully
- [ ] Deployment verified working

### Post-Migration
- [ ] Test all application features
- [ ] Verify authentication flow
- [ ] Test file uploads
- [ ] Check routing on all pages
- [ ] Update DNS (if using custom domain)
- [ ] Update any external service webhooks
- [ ] Delete Netlify deployment (after verification)

## 🌐 Custom Domain (Optional)

### If you had a custom domain on Netlify:

1. **In Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to Project Settings → Domains
   - Add your custom domain
   - Note the DNS configuration provided

2. **Update DNS Records**:
   - Point your domain to Vercel's servers
   - Update CNAME/A records as instructed

3. **Update Supabase**:
   - Add your custom domain to Supabase auth settings

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Build Failures**:
- Ensure `npm run build` works locally
- Check for TypeScript errors
- Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`

**Authentication Issues**:
- Verify Supabase redirect URLs include your Vercel domain
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure URLs don't have trailing slashes

**Routing Problems**:
- `vercel.json` handles SPA routing automatically
